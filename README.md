Encryption with Key

This repository demonstrates a simple implementation of encryption and decryption using a key-based cryptographic algorithm. It is designed to provide an easy-to-understand example of how symmetric and asymmetric encryption works, focusing on the use of keys to secure data.
Features

    Symmetric encryption: Encrypt and decrypt data using the same key.
    Asymmetric encryption: Use a public and private key pair for encrypting and decrypting messages.
    Support for different encryption algorithms: Includes support for AES, RSA, and other common cryptographic techniques.
    Key generation and management: Utilities to securely generate and store keys.

Getting Started

    Clone this repository: 

git clone https://github.com/cr33p3n/key-encrypt.git

.exe can dont work how .cpp which you build by yourself because i dont update .exe
